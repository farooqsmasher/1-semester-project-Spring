Ebaling-outsourcing using key updates

## Abstract
This application is a third party auditing service which enhances the security and eliminates the key exposure in cloud application. The TPA helps the client to complete a high security file upload and download with transparency in the key updation. Thus inclusion of a third party auditing will eliminate the burden on the clientâ€™s side. Thus TPA will generate a highly encrypt class of the key which is private key of the client. The client can authenti- cate the encrypted private key. This key updation will en- able the users to validate and verify the secret keys provid- ed by the TPA. This is a feature which helps in implement- ing safe and clear auditing for the users or the clients.

## Modules
Setup: The working of the algorithm takes place in such a way that when the algorithm takes an input a security criterion/parameter Ck which returns two keys such as a public key and a Master key as Pk and Mk respectively. The Master key Mk generates a secret key for the user and the Pk is used for encryption by the message sender . 
Encrypt : For the successful Encryption and generated output cipher text CT , the input parameter such as Pk , Message M and a access Structure T is used by the algorithm. 
Key-Gen : This algorithm functions when the Master and secret key Mk feeds value to the master secret key Mk generating a secret key key Sk that enables the user to decrypt a message with the access tree T if only it matches the T.  
Decrypt : In this algorithm for an attribute set the cipher text CT and the secret key SK feeds an output which enhances the performance over the disadvantage of the private key. So an user only use this set of attributes to satisfy the access structure in the encrypted data. This in case of KP-ABE enhances the access control which in addition makes the users private key a 
set of the attributes that satisfies the given structure along with the encrypted data.
